# Superstore SQL Cleaning & Analysis

In this project, I worked with a fictional Superstore dataset to perform SQL-based data cleaning and business analysis. The database contained inconsistent data types, missing values, and untidy structures.

## Goals
- Clean and convert text-based dates and numeric fields
- Impute missing values logically
- Identify top-performing products by category based on sales and profit
- Join multiple tables to derive deeper business insights

## Tables Used
- `orders`
- `products`
- `people`
- `returned_orders`

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- SQL JOINs
- CTEs and window functions (`RANK`)
- `TO_DATE()` and `CAST()` for cleaning
- Filtering, aggregation, and sorting for business KPIs
- Handling missing values and schema mismatches
